2.	Output average price of books in stock [note: only title with stock levels > 0 should be included in the calculation].
3.	Output a report detailing the number of books existing in each genre type.

**ADVANCED FEATURES**

5.	Query if a book title is available and present option of (a) increasing stock level or (b) decreasing the stock level, due to a sale. If the stock level is decreased to zero indicate to the user that the book is currently out of stock. 
6.	Query the List to return book items ordered in alphabetic order by title or genre.
