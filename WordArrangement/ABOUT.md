"Word Arrangement" was the first Java assignment given to us in Year 1.

It contained core concepts including objects and classes, arrays, strings and file handling. It taught me how to maintain readable and maintainable code, as well as how to go about naming conventions. This exam taught me how to divide time and how to test a program.

This was done using IntelliJ but former experience was with NetBeans.
